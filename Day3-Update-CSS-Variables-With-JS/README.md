In this build we update CSS variable with JS using a slider on the frontend!

The way that CSS variables work is such that you set them on the source of the elements. To do this we first set the CSS attributes using variable declarations.

To begin applying JavaScript we use the document.querySelectorAll(); on the page

I particularly did not enjoy this build as some scripts didn't run.
